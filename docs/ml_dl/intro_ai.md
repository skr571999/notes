# Introduction

## Libraries

- **Numpy** - Array
- **Pandas** - for reading data and displaying that in tabular form
- **Matplotlib** - For graphical representation of data
  - Data Visualization
  - Types of the Plot - Bar Graph, Pie Plot, Histograms, Hexagonal Bin Plot, Area Plot, Scatter Plot
- **sklearn**
  - fit Resets a Model - An important property of scikit-learn models is that calling fit will always reset everything a model previously learned.

## Data Processing

- Converts raw data into a readable format that can be interpreted, analyzed, and used for a variety of purposes.
- The collection and manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information.

## Training and Testing

- Dividing the data into two parts one for training the model and the other part for the testing the model. In testing we comparing the predicted output of the model with the actual output present and calculate the difference between them.
- **Cost function** - This is the difference or distance between the predicted value and the actual value

## Steps of the Learning

- Defining a Problem
- Preparing Data
- Model Development
  - Selecting the Algorithms by doing the data analysis
  - Training
- Model Evaluation - Testing - Confusion Matrices
- Making some predictions

## Types of Learning

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Semi Supervised Learning

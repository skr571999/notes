## Basics Terminology

- Software
  - Software is set of Instructions that tell the computer what to do.
- Instruction
  - Instruction is a order given to a computer

## About Python

- Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991.

## Terminology

- **Software** - is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do.

- **Software development** - process of Designing, Deploying and Maintaining software.

- We write programs using the high level language but the computer does not understand high level language because it understands the programs written in 0 and 1 binary called Machine code. A program written in high level language is called Source code.

- So to make computer understand the code written in high level language we need to convert it to the machine code

- To convert the Source code into machine code we use Compiler or Interpreter

- Compiler and Interpreter are the programs that convert the Source code to Machine code

- **Compiler** - takes the entire program and converts it into machine code which is stored in a file which can be directly executed by the machine. Compiled languages - C, C++

- **Interpreter** - directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to machine code. Interpreted languages - Python, JavaScript

- Note
  - Interpreted programs run slower than the compiled programs.
  - Java programs are first compiled and then interpreted by the interpreter.

## Types of Software

- System Software
  - OS
  - Language Translators
    - Compilers
    - Assemblers
    - Interpreters
- Utility Software
- Applications Software
  - General Purpose
    - Word, Excel
  - Customized Software
    - Web Applications
    - Desktop Applications
    - Android Application

## Operating System

- It is the master program that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
- Application --> OS --> Driver --> Device

## Software Versioning

- Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
  - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  - PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## What is the difference b/w Synchronous and Asynchronous

- Synchronous - occurring at the same time.
- Asynchronous - not occurring at the same time.
- Synchronization - the action of causing a set of data or files to remain identical in more than one location.

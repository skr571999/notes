Simple notes about the Software and software development.

<!--truncate-->

- **Software** - is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do.

- **Software development** - refers to a set of activities dedicated to the process of Creating, Designing, Deploying and Supporting software.

- Need Of Programming

- We write programs using the high level language but the computer does not understand high level language because it understands the programs written in 0 and 1 binary called Machine code. A program written in high level language is called Source code.

- So to make computer understand the code written in high level language we need to convert it to the machine code

- To convert the Source code into machine code we use Compiler or Interpreter

- Compiler and Interpreter are the programs that convert the Source code to Machine code

- **Compiler** - takes the entire program and converts it into machine code which is stored in a file which can be directly executed by the machine.

  - Compiled languages - C, C++

- **Interpreter** - directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to machine code.

  - Interpreted languages - Python, JavaScript

- Note
  - Interpreted programs run slower than the compiled programs.
  - Java programs are first compiled and then interpreted by the interpreter.
